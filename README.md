# Radiant-Night

Radiant Night is an independently made passion project of mine made using Unity. It was the primary method I had for honing the skills I learned from my college degree post-graduation. The concept of the project has been in the works for years, and this is the culmination of it all.

The game is a turn based RPG in which the player is able to use the unique fighting styles and abilities of a large variety of characters. Unlike many games of this genre, characters are not acquired by the luck of the draw, but by going through that character's storyline and earning their trust and friendship.

The game currently has a functioning dialogue system which will be heavily utilized throughout the game as it is very story oriented.

A quest system is also implemented, showing the player all of the active quests they can currently complete. This is not throughly used yet but it is ready when the time comes.

The combat system is currently in early development, with two character kits in the works.

NOTE: All art is temporary! Many models are placeholders or will be improved upon in future development.
